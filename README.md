# Cryptocurrencies

### Overview

The purpose of this project was to use unsupervised machine learning in order to analyze a dataset of cryptocurrencies. We preprocessed the data, reduced the dimensions by utilizing PCA, clustered the currencies by using K-Means, and expressed visual results with 2D and 3D models.

We produced the elbow curve below using the K-Means method iterating from 1-10. We see that the best value to use was 4.

This scatterplot was from using the PCA algorithm in order to reduce the cryptocurrencies dimensioons to three principal components.


Below is the cryptocurrencies table.

We see that using the PCA algorithm is a better visualization.
